# Hair Atlas

Hair Atlas is a machine learning project designed for **hairstyle recommendations**.  
It analyzes facial images, preprocesses them, trains a model, and suggests the most suitable hairstyles for users.

## 🚀 Features
- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation).  
- Model training using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- Real-time hairstyle recommendation based on input image.  
- Simple web-based interface via Flask/Streamlit (`app.py`).  
- Organized folder structure for dataset, models, and results.

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hair_Atlas.git
cd Hair_Atlas
Option 1: Using pip
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Option 2: Using Conda
bash
Copy code
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate hair_atlas
▶️ Usage
1. Preprocess the Dataset
Place your dataset in the data/raw/ folder, then run:

bash

python preprocess.py
2. Train the Model
bash
Copy code
python train.py
The trained model will be saved in the models/ directory.

3. Run the Application
bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will launch the web application for hairstyle recommendations.

4. Test OpenCV (Optional)
bash
Copy code
python test_cv2.py
📦 Dependencies
Key libraries and tools used:

Python 3.8+

TensorFlow / Keras – for model training

OpenCV – for image handling and face detection

NumPy, Pandas – for data processing

Flask / Streamlit – for deployment and user interface

scikit-learn – for ML utilities

🔮 Future Improvements
Expand dataset with diverse hairstyles.

Improve model accuracy with CNN / Transfer Learning.

Add a profile system for saving user preferences.

Deploy as a full-stack web application.

Integrate real-time camera input for live recommendations.

⚡ Next Step: I can also **generate `environment.yml` and environment.txt** (clean versions) for you.  
👉 Do you want me to create those files now along with this README?
